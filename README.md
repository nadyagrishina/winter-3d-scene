## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Project Description

This semester project simulates a small **winter landscape** with a house and falling snow using Java and OpenGL (LWJGL).  
Snowflakes are animated with a simple particle system. When they reach the ground, they leave visible accumulation marks.  
The project includes textured 3D models, user interaction (mouse and keyboard), HUD display, and performance metrics (FPS counter).

## üß© Technologies Used

- Java 21
- OpenGL (via LWJGL 3)
- STB EasyFont (text rendering)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- macOS for development (also works on Windows/Linux)

---

## üì¶ Project Contents

- `src/` ‚Äì Source code (Java)
- `textures/` ‚Äì All used texture files
- `out/artifacts/project-pgrf2.jar` ‚Äì Executable fat JAR (macOS only)
- `mac-run.sh` ‚Äì Shell script for easy macOS launch
- `used_sources.txt` ‚Äì List of external resources used

## üöÄ How to Run

This package contains both **source code** and a precompiled **JAR file for macOS**.

---

### üõ† Requirements

- Java 21
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended for building from source)
- LWJGL 3 (included in JAR, required manually if running from source)

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the JAR on macOS

Use the shell script:

```bash
./mac-run.sh
```
Or manually:
```bash
java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar ./project-pgrf2.jar
```
‚ö†Ô∏è This JAR was built and tested on macOS only.It includes native libraries for macOS and will not run on Windows or Linux.

### üíª Running on Windows / Linux / Other OS

To run the project from source:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Set Java SDK to version 21.
3. Add LWJGL 3 manually:
    - Required JARs: lwjgl.jar, lwjgl-glfw.jar, lwjgl-opengl.jar, lwjgl-stb.jar
    - Native libraries:
        - Windows: natives-windows
        - Linux: natives-linux
        - macOS: natives-macos
4. Run:
   In IntelliJ IDEA:  
   Right-click on `App.java` (in `com.nadyagrishina`) ‚Üí **Run 'App.main()'**
