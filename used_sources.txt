   Description: Texture of the chimney

2. door.png

   Description: Texture of the door

3. ground.jpg

   Description: Texture of the ground

4. roof_snow_00.jpg

      Description: Base roof texture used for the house

      Derived textures (created manually based on the original):
      - roof_snow_25.png
      - roof_snow_50.png
      - roof_snow_75.png
      - roof_snow_90.png
      These were generated by blending the original roof texture with white color and light noise to simulate gradual snow coverage.

9. Font STBEasyFont
   Author: Sean Barrett
   Part of the LWJGL library, used for simple text rendering

10. LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library)
    Website: https://www.lwjgl.org/
    Used for OpenGL rendering, input management and low-level access

11. LWJGL samples (course templates and examples)
    Source: https://gitlab.com/Bruno.Jezek/lwjgl-samples.git
    Note: Partially used as a starting point – e.g. GLCamera, renderer, transforms, texture handling, and OpenGL initialization

12. Custom implementation
    Author: Nadezhda Grishina
    The camera, snow particle system, scene management, rendering, interaction and user interface were fully implemented in Java using OpenGL (LWJGL).
